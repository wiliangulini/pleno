# React-Basic-Video-Chat

A basic video chat application using React and OpenTok.

## Demo

You can see a demo of this sample running at [opentok.github.io/opentok-web-samples/React-Basic-Video-Chat/](https://opentok.github.io/opentok-web-samples/React-Basic-Video-Chat/)

> **Note** The demo is setup so that a new room is generated based on your public IP address. So will only work if you are connecting from 2 browsers on the same network.

## Setting your OpenTok apiKey, sessionId and token

Before you can run this application you need to modify [config.js](src/config.js) and include your OpenTok API Key, Session ID and a valid token or set your server URL. For more details on how to get these values see [Token creation
overview](https://tokbox.com/opentok/tutorials/create-token/).

## Running the App

Run `npm start` to start the application
